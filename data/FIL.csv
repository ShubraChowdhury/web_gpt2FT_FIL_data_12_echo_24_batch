Statement of Applicability: The contents of, and material referenced in, this FIL apply to all FDIC-supervised financial institutions.  Highlights Severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding caused significant property damage in areas of Texas on April 26, 2024 and continuing.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared a federal disaster for selected areas affected in Texas on May 17, 2024.  FEMA may make additional designations after damage assessments are completed in the affected areas.  A current list of designated areas is available at www.fema.gov. The FDIC is encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers experiencing difficulties beyond their control because of damage caused by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding. Banks that extend repayment terms, restructure existing loans, or ease terms for new loans in a manner consistent with sound banking practices can contribute to the health of the local community and serve the long-term interests of the lending institution. Banks may receive favorable Community Reinvestment Act consideration for community development loans, investments, and services in support of disaster recovery. The FDIC also will consider regulatory relief from certain filing and publishing requirements SUPERVISORY PRACTICES REGARDING DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND BORROWERS AFFECTED BY SEVERE STORMS, STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS, TORNADOES, AND FLOODING IN TEXAS  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recognizes the serious impact of severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding on customers and operations of financial institutions in affected areas of Texas and will provide regulatory assistance to institutions subject to its supervision.  These initiatives will provide regulatory relief and facilitate recovery.  The FDIC encourages depository institutions in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.  The affected areas in Texas are Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, Polk, San Jacinto, Trinity, and Walker Counties.   Lending: The FDIC encourages bankers to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding. The FDIC realizes the effects of natural disasters on local businesses and individuals are often transitory, and prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism.  In supervising institutions affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding, the FDIC will consider the unusual circumstances they face.  The FDIC recognizes that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound banking practices as well as in the public interest.1  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas.  For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at Section 12(g)(4)(ii).  For help in identifying community development activities to revitalize or stabilize a disaster area, financial institutions can contact their regional Community Affairs Officer.  Investments: Bankers are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding.  The FDIC realizes local government projects may be negatively affected and encourages bankers to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.  Reporting Requirements: FDIC-supervised institutions affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding should notify the Dallas Regional Office if they expect a delay in filing Reports of Income and Condition or other reports.  The FDIC will evaluate any causes beyond the control of a reporting institution when considering the length of an acceptable delay.  Publishing Requirements: The FDIC understands the damage caused by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations.  Banks experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact the Dallas Regional Office.  Consumer Laws: For consumers’ principal dwelling-secured loans, Regulation Z provides consumers an option to waive or modify the three-day rescission period when a “bona fide personal financial emergency” exists.  To exercise this option, the consumer must provide the lender with a statement describing the emergency in accordance with the regulation.  Temporary Banking Facilities: The Dallas Regional Office will expedite any request to operate temporary banking facilities by an institution whose offices have been damaged or that desires to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding.  In most cases, a telephone notice to the FDIC will suffice initially. Institutions may submit necessary written notification later.  1 Institutions that report modifications of existing loans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 310-40, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors should evaluate those modifications individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings.  For institutions that have adopted ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether the modification of the existing loan is a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Under both ASC Topic 326 and ASU 2022-02, this evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification.  FIL-27-2024"

These reporting changes proposed by the agencies on September 28, 2023 (see FIL-53-2023) and December 27, 2023 (see FIL-68-2023), would apply to all three versions of the Call Report (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051) and to the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002), as applicable, and are subject to approval by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.  In the September 2023 notice, the agencies proposed revisions to all three versions of the Call Report (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041 and FFIEC 051) and the Board proposed revisions, as applicable, to the FFIEC 002 related to the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures” (ASU 2022-02), reporting on internet website addresses of depository institution trade names, and reporting on past due loans. In the December 2023 notice, the agencies proposed revisions to all three versions of the Call Report (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041 and FFIEC 051) and the Board proposed revisions, as applicable, to the FFIEC 002 related to the reporting of loans to nondepository financial institutions (NDFIs) and other loans, guaranteed structured financial products, and proposed long-term debt requirements. In addition, this notice included a proposal to adopt ongoing standards for electronic signatures to comply with the Call Report signature and attestation requirement.   After considering the comments received on these notices, the agencies are moving forward with certain proposed revisions related to replacing references to “troubled debt restructurings” with “modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty” consistent with ASU 2022-02, the reporting on the internet website addresses of depository institution trade names, and the adoption of the standards for electronic signatures. These updates to the Call Report and FFIEC 002 report forms and instructions will be effective as of the June 30, 2024, report date.   The agencies are implementing revisions related to reporting of loans to NDFIs as of the December 31, 2024, report date. The agencies are also adding a new Memorandum item that would identify the amounts reported as a structured financial product that are guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies, which would be effective as of the December 31, 2024, report date.  The agencies are continuing to review comment letters related to loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty under ASU 2022-02, as well as the proposed clarification on the reporting of past due loans and proposed reporting of long-term debt requirements, for further changes to the Call Report and the FFIEC 002.   The agencies encourage you to review the proposed regulatory reporting revisions and comment on those aspects of interest to you. You may send comments on this reporting proposal to any or all of the agencies by the methods described in the attached Federal Register notice. Comments must be submitted by June 21, 2024.   Redlined copies of the FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051 Call Report forms and the FFIEC 002 report form showing the proposed changes and the related draft reporting instructions will be available on the FFIEC’s webpages for these reports, which can be accessed from the FFIEC’s Reporting Forms webpage.  Please share this letter with individuals responsible for preparing Call Reports at your institution.  For further information about the proposed Call Report changes, institutions should contact their assigned Call Report analyst. If you do not know the analyst assigned to your institution, state member institutions should contact their Federal Reserve District Bank, while national institutions, FDIC-supervised banks, and savings associations should contact the FDIC’s Data Collection and Analysis Section in Washington, D.C., by telephone at (800) 688‑FDIC (3342) or email to FDICInfoReq@fdic.gov.

7,https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/incentive-based-compensation-arrangements,FIL-21-2024,Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements,"Summary: On May 3, 2024, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) and request for comment entitled Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements, a rule to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  In this NPR, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively the “Agencies” for purposes of this NPR) are re-proposing the regulatory text previously proposed in June 2016, along with certain alternatives and questions, for public comment.1  The NPR would provide a consistent set of enforceable standards and help safeguard covered financial institutions from certain types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution.  Statement of Applicability: This proposed rulemaking does not apply to FDIC-supervised institutions with less than $1 billion in average total consolidated assets.  Key Details: On June 10, 2016, an NPR to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act was published in the Federal Register (2016 NPR).2 In consideration of the passage of time since the 2016 NPR, as well as additional supervisory experience, changes in industry practices and other developments, the Agencies are issuing this NPR and seeking additional feedback from commenters by re-proposing the 2016 regulatory text and proposing potential alternatives for consideration. Comments received on this NPR as well as those previously submitted on the 2016 NPR will further inform efforts to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The NPR uses a tiered approach that would apply provisions to covered financial institutions according to three categories of average total consolidated assets: Level 1 ($250 billion or more), Level 2 ($50 billion to $250 billion), and Level 3 ($1 billion to $50 billion). For all covered institutions, the proposed rule would: Prohibit types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks. Require adherence to basic principles for incentive-based compensation arrangements to balance between risk and reward and establish effective risk management governance. Require appropriate board of directors (or committee) oversight, recordkeeping, and disclosures to the appropriate agency. For Level 1 and Level 2 institutions, the proposed rule would: Require the following: deferral of awards for senior executive officers (SEOs) and significant risk-takers (SRTs); consideration of forfeiture or downward adjustment of awards; provide for clawback of paid awards; establishment of a board compensation committee; appropriate risk management and control framework; additional recordkeeping requirements for SEOs and SRTs; and policies and procedures to ensure rule compliance.   Prohibit or limit: excessive award leveraging; using only relative (peer) performance measures; use of options; volume-driven incentive-based compensation without regard to transaction quality or compliance with sound risk management; and the purchasing of hedging instruments by an institution on behalf of a covered person to offset any decrease in the value of incentive-based compensation. Potential Alternatives to Regulatory Provisions: The NPR is also seeking feedback on potential alternatives to the proposal’s regulatory provisions including, but not limited to, shortening the compliance date; establishing a two-level structure for covered institutions; simplifying the SRT definition; and requiring performance measures and targets be established before the performance period.    Comments on potential alternatives are also being sought on topics such as options; requiring, instead of requiring consideration of, forfeiture and downward adjustments; clawback; hedging; volume driven incentive-based compensation; and risk management and control requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 covered institutions. Until this proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal Register, comments on the proposed rule and alternatives in the preamble can be sent to IncentiveCompProposal2024@fdic.gov and will be posted on the FDIC website at https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/publiccomments/.  1 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) has not acted to join this NPR.  Rulemaking to implement section 956 is on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rulemaking agenda.  2 The 2016 NPR was issued by the FDIC, the OCC, the NCUA, the FHFA, SEC and the Board.

Statement of Applicability: The contents of, and material referenced in, this FIL apply to all FDIC-supervised financial  institutions.  Highlights: Severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding caused significant property damage in areas of Oklahoma on April 25, 2024 and continuing.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared a federal disaster for selected areas affected in Oklahoma on April 30, 2024.  FEMA may make additional designations after damage assessments are completed in the affected areas.  A current list of designated areas is available at www.fema.gov.  The FDIC is encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers experiencing difficulties beyond their control because of damage caused by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding.  Banks that extend repayment terms, restructure existing loans, or ease terms for new loans in a manner consistent with sound banking practices can contribute to the health of the local community and serve the long-term interests of the lending institution.  Banks may receive favorable Community Reinvestment Act consideration for community development loans, investments, and services in support of disaster recovery. The FDIC also will consider regulatory relief from certain filing and publishing requirements. SUPERVISORY PRACTICES REGARDING DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND BORROWERS AFFECTED BY SEVERE STORMS, STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS, TORNADOES, AND FLOODING IN OKLAHOMA  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recognizes the serious impact of severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding on customers and operations of financial institutions in affected areas of Oklahoma and will provide regulatory assistance to institutions subject to its supervision.  These initiatives will provide regulatory relief and facilitate recovery.  The FDIC encourages depository institutions in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.  The affected areas in Oklahoma are Hughes, Love, and Murray Counties.   Lending:The FDIC encourages bankers to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding.  The FDIC realizes the effects of natural disasters on local businesses and individuals are often transitory, and prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism.  In supervising institutions affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding, the FDIC will consider the unusual circumstances they face.  The FDIC recognizes that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound banking practices as well as in the public interest.1  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas.  For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at Section 12(g)(4)(ii).  For help in identifying community development activities to revitalize or stabilize a disaster area, financial institutions can contact their regional Community Affairs Officer.  Investments: Bankers are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding.  The FDIC realizes local government projects may be negatively affected and encourages bankers to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.  Reporting Requirements: FDIC-supervised institutions affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding should notify the Dallas Regional Office if they expect a delay in filing Reports of Income and Condition or other reports.  The FDIC will evaluate any causes beyond the control of a reporting institution when considering the length of an acceptable delay.  Publishing Requirements: The FDIC understands the damage caused by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations.  Banks experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact the Dallas Regional Office.  Consumer Laws: For consumers’ principal dwelling-secured loans, Regulation Z provides consumers an option to waive or modify the three-day rescission period when a “bona fide personal financial emergency” exists.  To exercise this option, the consumer must provide the lender with a statement describing the emergency in accordance with the regulation.  Temporary Banking Facilities: The Dallas Regional Office will expedite any request to operate temporary banking facilities by an institution whose offices have been damaged or that desires to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding. In most cases, a telephone notice to the FDIC will suffice initially.  Institutions may submit necessary written notification later.  1 Institutions that report modifications of existing loans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 310-40, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors should evaluate those modifications individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings.  For institutions that have adopted ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether the modification of the existing loan is a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Under both ASC Topic 326 and ASU 2022-02, this evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification."

Statement of Applicability: This Financial Institution Letter (FIL) applies to all FDIC-supervised financial institutions.  Key Details: Community banks engage with third parties to help the banks compete in and respond to an evolving financial services landscape.  Third-party relationships can offer community banks access to new technologies, risk management tools, human capital, delivery channels, products, services, and markets. A community bank’s reliance on third parties, however, reduces its direct operational control over activities and may introduce new risks or increase existing risks, including but not limited to, operational, compliance, financial, and strategic risks. A community bank’s use of third parties does not diminish or remove a bank’s  responsibility to perform all activities in a safe and sound manner, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to consumer protection and security of customer information. This Guide is intended as a resource for community banks to consider when developing third-party risk management programs, policies, and practices by providing potential considerations and examples for each stage of the third-party risk management life cycle. The Guide is not a substitute for the Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management.  This Guide is not a checklist and does not prescribe specific risk management practices or establish any safe harbors for compliance with laws or regulations."

The Office of the Ombudsman operates independent of the agency’s divisions that issue supervisory determinations, and reports to the office of the FDIC Chairman.  The Office of the Ombudsman serves as an impartial liaison to facilitate effective communication of relevant information between parties, with a focus on providing a fair and transparent resolution process.  To encourage external parties to consult an Ombudsman, the Office has safeguards that preserve the confidentiality of those seeking its assistance.  The FDIC encourages bankers and other stakeholders to use the Office of the Ombudsman as an independent, neutral, and confidential resource for informally discussing disagreements with findings or conclusions of the agency, and for identifying strategies and options to facilitate fair outcomes.  The Office of the Ombudsman’s 2023 Report can be found on the FDIC’s website.  Statement of Applicability: The contents of, and material referenced in, this FIL apply to all FDIC-supervised financial institutions.

This advisory reminds institutions of the information required to be collected from the customer prior to account opening.  Statement of Applicability: The contents of, and material referenced in, this FIL apply to all FDIC-supervised financial institutions.  Highlights: In 2003, the final CIP Rule was issued for banks, savings associations, credit unions, and certain non-federally regulated banks. The CIP Rule requires a bank to implement a program that includes risk-based verification procedures that enable the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers. These requirements exist regardless of whether the bank establishes this relationship directly with the customer or through an intermediary. These procedures must include collecting, at a minimum, the customer’s name, date of birth (for an individual), address, and identification number. A bank is required to collect the taxpayer identification number (TIN) from a customer that is a U.S. person prior to account opening or another approved identification from a non-U.S. person. This applies to all accounts with the exception of credit card accounts. To gain an understanding of the issues related to the TIN collection, FinCEN is seeking information and comment from banks and interested parties regarding the CIP Rule’s TIN collection requirement through a Request for Information: Customer Identification Program Rule Taxpayer Identification Number Collection Requirement."

Statement of Applicability: The contents of, and material referenced in, this FIL apply to all FDIC-supervised financial institutions.  Highlights: A severe storm, landslides, and mudslides caused significant property damage in an area of Alaska on November 20, 2023.

FEMA may make additional designations after damage assessments are completed in the affected areas. A current list of designated areas is available at www.fema.gov. The FDIC is encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers experiencing difficulties beyond their control because of damage caused by a severe storm, landslides, and mudslides. Banks that extend repayment terms, restructure existing loans, or ease terms for new loans in a manner consistent with sound banking practices can contribute to the health of the local community and serve the long-term interests of the lending institution. Banks may receive favorable Community Reinvestment Act consideration for community development loans, investments, and services in support of disaster recovery. The FDIC also will consider regulatory relief from certain filing and publishing requirements. SUPERVISORY PRACTICES REGARDING DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND BORROWERS AFFECTED BY A SEVERE STORM, LANDSLIDES, AND MUDSLIDES IN ALASKA The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recognizes the serious impact of a severe storm, landslides, and mudslides on customers and operations of financial institutions in the affected area of Alaska and will provide regulatory assistance to institutions subject to its supervision. These initiatives will provide regulatory relief and facilitate recovery. The FDIC encourages depository institutions in the affected area to meet the financial services needs of their communities.  The affected area in Alaska is Sealaska (Native Regional Corporation).  Lending: The FDIC encourages bankers to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the severe storm, landslides, and mudslides. The FDIC realizes the effects of natural disasters on local businesses and individuals are often transitory, and prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. In supervising institutions affected by the severe storm, landslides, and mudslides the FDIC will consider the unusual circumstances they face. The FDIC recognizes that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound banking practices as well as in the public interest.1  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at Section 12(g)(4)(ii). For help in identifying community development activities to revitalize or stabilize a disaster area, financial institutions can contact their regional Community Affairs Officer.  Investments: Bankers are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the severe storm, landslides, and mudslides. The FDIC realizes local government projects may be negatively affected and encourages bankers to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.  Reporting Requirements: FDIC-supervised institutions affected by the severe storm, landslides, and mudslides should notify the San Francisco Regional Office if they expect a delay in filing Reports of Income and Condition or other reports. The FDIC will evaluate any causes beyond the control of a reporting institution when considering the length of an acceptable delay.  Publishing Requirements: The FDIC understands the damage caused by the severe storm, landslides, and mudslides may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Banks experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact the San Francisco Regional Office.  Consumer Laws: For consumers’ principal dwelling-secured loans, Regulation Z provides consumers an option to waive or modify the three-day rescission period when a “bona fide personal financial emergency” exists. To exercise this option, the consumer must provide the lender with a statement describing the emergency in accordance with the regulation.  Temporary Banking Facilities: The San Francisco Regional Office will expedite any request to operate temporary banking facilities by an institution whose offices have been damaged or that desires to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the severe storm, landslides, and mudslides. In most cases, a telephone notice to the FDIC will suffice initially. Institutions may submit necessary written notification later.     1 Institutions that report modifications of existing loans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 310-40, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors should evaluate those modifications individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings. For institutions that have adopted ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether the modification of the existing loan is a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Under both ASC Topic 326 and ASU 2022-02, this evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification."

Statement of Applicability: The contents of, and material referenced in, this FIL apply to all FDIC-supervised financial institutions.

The exception expires three years after the date Maui County was declared a major disaster. To qualify for the exception, an institution must determine that: The transaction involves real property located in the area designated as adversely affected by the major disaster. There is a binding commitment to fund the transaction1 that was entered into on or after August 10, 2023, but no later than August 10, 2026. The value of the real property supports the institution’s decision to enter into the transaction. Transactions for which the financial institution relies on the appraisal exception must continue to be subject to review by management. The FDIC will review an institution’s reliance on the appraisal exception during regularly scheduled examinations."
